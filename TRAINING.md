To train our robot arm to eventually be able to assemble six cups into a stack and later disassemble them into a tower. We split our model into multiple tasks that we had to train with at least 20 episodes in order for the robot to understand our movements to a greater extent.

We trained two separate models - one to assemble the stack, one to disassemble it into a tower.

We had four cameras - one on the top, two on the side, and one on the wrist.
